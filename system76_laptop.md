### Lights on the front

There are 8 little lights on the front of the machine

- speedometer (CPU?)
- scroll lock?
- cap lock
- number lock
- airplane mode
- hard disk
- power adapter (yellow if not fully charged)
- power on (blinking when suspended)

### keyboard shortcuts

- `<super>-P` controls display setup (mirror/joined/built-in/external),
  but it forces you to have very small text

- `<super>` then type app name

- `<super>-t` to open new terminal
- `<ctrl>-<shift>-t` to open new tab within terminal
- `<ctrl>-<pgup/pgdn>` or `<alt>-[number]` to switch between terminal tabs
- `<super>-<tab>` to switch between apps
- `<super>-~` to switch between windows of a given app

- arrange windows: `<ctrl><super><arrow key>`
- arrange windows more thoroughly with gTile: `<super><enter (on number pad)>`

- `<ctrl>-c/v` for copy-paste except in terminal where you must use `<ctrl>-<shift>-c/v`
- clipboard indicator for clipboard with memory:
  - `<ctrl>-F9` toggle menu
  - `<ctrl>-F10` clear history (oops!)
  - `<ctrl>-F11` previous entry
  - `<ctrl>-F12` next entry
