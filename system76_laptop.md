### Lights on the front

There are 8 little lights on the front of the machine

- speedometer (CPU?)
- scroll lock?
- cap lock
- number lock
- airplane mode
- hard disk
- power adapter
- battery

### keyboard shortcuts

<super>-P controls display setup (mirror/joined/built-in/external),
but it forces you to have very small text

<super> then type app name

<super>-t to open new terminal
<ctrl>-<shift>-t to open new tab within terminal
<ctrl>-<pgup/pgdn> or <alt>-[number] to switch between terminal tabs
<super>-<tab> to switch between apps
<super>-~ to switch between windows of a given app
