## Notes on bitbucket pull requests

- Visit <https://bitbucket.org/myfriend/repo>

- Click "Fork" button at top right to make my own version of it

- On command line on computer:

  ```
  git clone git@bitbucket.org:kbroman/repo.git
  ```

- Make a bunch of changes, `git add`; `git commit`; `git push`

  Changes are then on *my* repository but not yours

- On my version of repo at bitbucket, I click "Pull request" button

- I think you then go to your repo on git hub, view the pull request, and click "approve" and then "merge"

- Then back on your computer, `git pull`

- (There may be conflicts to deal with)
